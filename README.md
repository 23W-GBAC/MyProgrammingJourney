# A "Retroactive" Journey Into Progamming
---
## 0. Intro

Hello, my name is Juan Pablo Herrrera Upegui, a student of Health Informatics at ECRI. This is a blog/project for GBAC class, it contains information about my experience and my description of the first steps to take as a beginner programmer. It also shows my idea regarding an automation project, as well as, the planning and the execution of it.

The intention is to portray a relatable blog as an educational tool, because, in my experience, I've found that I tend to learn better and easier when I am explaining a topic to a peer (makes me feel more reassured of my knowledge) or there is an analogy involved when someone explains something to me. There is a saying I've heard: 'When one teaches, two learn!', which is something that I truly believe in. This means that writting this blog helps me understand better what I learn during the GBAC class.

With that being said, I thank you and leave you to it, enjoy...

The table below will help you navigate the different topics of my blog. The structure of the table is "upside down" (I wanted to keep that blog-type vibe) the purpose is to show the audience what I'm currently working on and display the most recent posts, also, it is easier for me to just keep adding updates at the top of the list and edit accordingly.
